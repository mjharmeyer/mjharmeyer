Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Harmeyer, I am currently a second-year student at the Ohio State University, pursuing a degree in Data Analytics and Economics and currently searching for an internship in data science. I'm passionate about leveraging data to gain insights and solve real-world problems. Outside of class, I am learning and improving my data science skills by working on various projects and coursework. I'm excited to collaborate with others on data science projects and learn from experienced professionals. You can reach me via email at harmeyer.27@osu.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelharmeyer/).
